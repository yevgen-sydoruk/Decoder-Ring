This project was designed to challenge the ability to build complex algorithms. It also tests the ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test the algorithms.
This project covers such learning objectives as:
1. writing a series of unit tests using Mocha and Chai;
2. using different expect() methods to test the code.
